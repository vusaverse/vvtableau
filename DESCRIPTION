Description: Provides an R interface for interacting with the 'Tableau' Server.
    It allows users to perform various operations such as publishing workbooks, refreshing data extracts, 
    and managing users using the 'Tableau' REST API (see <https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref.htm> for details). Additionally, 
    it includes functions to perform manipulations on local 'Tableau' workbooks.
